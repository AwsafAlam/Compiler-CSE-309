# A Subset of C Compiler
### *8086 Assembly code generator*
---
*Compiler Course CSE 309*
#### This repository contains all the materials of the compiler course so far.
- Symbol Table
- Lexical Analyzer
- Parser (Syntax & Semantic Analyzer)
- Intermediate Representation (IR) for 8086 processor
---
### All the materials required to run this program are given in the repository

- Clone the repository using `git clone`
- Move to the Compiler Folder and execute `script.sh`
- This will generate assembly code for the corresponding input

---
Our main goal is to make a subset of the C compiler, and generate assembly code which can be converted into machine code
